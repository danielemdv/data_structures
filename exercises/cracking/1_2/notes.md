# A few notes on this exercise

- I wanted to first solve this problem without worrying about optimized code, so there's probably some shit code here
- The double `if` statements to build the word maps could be refactored into a single if statement
- This algo is most probably O(n) time and O(n) memory--if i remember correctly--as given the _worst_ cases, where both words are actually the same length, then both strings have to be iterated upon
- I'm not entirely sure if I covered all possible cases in my tests; please feel free to add cases and test @gangsterdan

# Notes on the notes

- Good job, this is a proper solution.
- Some things can be improved, less for loops can be used and try using only 1 map.
- Again, good job, you've got the proper logic going on, just polish it up a little.
