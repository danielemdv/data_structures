# A few notes on this exercise

- I wanted to first solve this problem without worrying about optimized code, so there's probably some shit code here
- The double `if` statements to build the word maps could be refactored into a single if statement
- This algo is most probably O(n) time and O(n) memory--if i remember correctly--as given the _worst_ cases, where both words are actually the same length, then both strings have to be iterated upon
- I'm not entirely sure if I covered all possible cases in my tests; please feel free to add cases and test @gangsterdan
