# Stuff I would like to cover.

- Step back and build some objects.
  - This will promote a better understanding of OOP

- Implement a generic ArrayList type data structure
  - We can reuse the code.

- Implement and play around with a linked list.
  - Do some linked list exercises. 

- Implement and play around with a hash table (hash map)
  - Having done enough exercises to be able to appreciate the simplicity and beauty of the hash table would be great.
