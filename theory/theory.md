# Stuff I would like to cover.

- Step back and build some objects.
  - This will promote a better understanding of OOP

- Implement a generic ArrayList type data structure
  - We can reuse the code.

- Implement and play around with a linked list.
  - Do some linked list exercises. 

- Implement and play around with a hash table (hash map)
  - Having done enough exercises to be able to appreciate the simplicity and beauty of the hash table would be great.

- Order the topics better... Structure them and make them easy to follow.

- New Idea: Program a function that checks if a tic tac toe game has been won by a player. This can be turned into a very simple two player command line game.
great exercise that crosses from the data structure world into more 'real life' programs (I don't really have a term for that.)
